Chess Party

For millennia, chess has been an iconic game; Prized as a way to showcase an individual’s mental and creative prowess. And in that millennia many variations have emerged, ranging from variants that make the game harder like 5-D Chess to variants that completely change the genre like FPS Chess. However, sometimes you just want to sit down with a buddy or a group of friends and relax and let the sisters of fate decide your destiny. That’s where this project attempts to cure your ailment: Chess Party. Modeled in the style of Mario Party where randomness is king, Chess Party introduces the universe’s own “creativity” to affect your games. Using object oriented programming, this project will allow full control over the state and settings of each individual piece and board section. With this control, random events like locking of a piece for a turn or turning a piece into a queen can happen, completely disrupting the well established dogma of how to play chess.
