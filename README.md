## Judge Average Scores:
Judge 1: 100/100
Judge 2: 90/100
Average Score: 190/200 = 95%

## Self Grading
Self Grade: 98%

## Grade Justification
We mostly agree with the Judges' assessments. Looking at each aspect of the rubric, we clearly recall satisfying the requirements given in the rubric. However, we do disagree with Judge #1's score on #6: Testing and CI-CD Pipeline. We utilized mocking, code coverage, Python type check, and hypothesis extensively. We have a Makefile that runs all of these commands to ensure our code is 100% compliant with common Python standards. With that being said, we believe our self grade would be 98%.

## How to Run
There are two ways to run this program:
From Linux/WSL terminal:
1. Navigate to CHESSPARTY folder
2. run command 'python3 game.py' (or python game.py)

On a Windows machine in VSCode:
1. Navigate to CHESSPARTY folder
2. Navigate to FinalBuild folder
3. Right-click and click on "Reveal in File Explorer
4. Extract to wherever and run .exe file accompanied by pawn.ico icon

## How to Test
1. Navigate to CHESSPARTY directory in WSL or VSCode
2. a. In WSL: run 'make all' and all tests + formatting commands will run with results recorded in your terminal
2. b. In VSCode: Open new terminal using CTRL + SHIFT + ' and run 'make all'
